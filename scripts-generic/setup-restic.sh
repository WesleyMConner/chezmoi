# Restic Backup Cheat Sheet

## 1. First-Time Setup

Initialize repo on SSD:

```bash
restic -r /mnt/backup/restic-repo init
```

## 2. Environment Setup (optional, makes commands shorter)

In `~/.restic-env`:

```bash
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/mnt/backup/restic-repo
export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourStrongPasswordHere
```

Load into shell:

```bash
source ~/.restic-env
```

---

## 3. Backup

Basic backup of `/home/x`:

```bash
restic backup /home/x
```

With exclude file (`~/.restic-excludes`):

```bash
restic backup /home/x --exclude-file=/home/x/.restic-excludes
```

---

## 4. Check Snapshots

List all snapshots:

```bash
restic snapshots
```

Show details of one snapshot:

```bash
restic snapshots --host $(hostname)
```

---

## 5. Restore

Restore latest backup to `/tmp/restore`:

```bash
restic restore latest --target /tmp/restore
```

Restore specific snapshot:

```bash
restic restore <snapshot-id> --target /tmp/restore
```

Restore a single file:

```bash
restic restore latest --target /tmp/restore --include /home/x/Documents/file.txt
```

---

## 6. Cleanup / Retention

Keep 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly snapshots:

```bash
restic forget --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 12 --prune
```

Keep only last 5 backups:

```bash
restic forget --keep-last 5 --prune
```

---

## 7. Integrity Checks

Verify repository:

```bash
restic check
```

Rebuild index (if needed):

```bash
restic rebuild-index
```

---

## 8. Useful Extras

Show repo stats (size, snapshots):

```bash
restic stats
```

Show files in a snapshot:

```bash
restic ls latest
```

---

**Golden rules**:

* Always test restores. Backups are only good if you can restore them.
* Never lose your repo password â€” without it, backups are unrecoverable.
* Unmount the SSD cleanly after backups:

  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt/backup
  ```

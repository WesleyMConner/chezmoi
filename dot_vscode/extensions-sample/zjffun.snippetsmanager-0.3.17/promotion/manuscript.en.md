Hello everyone, today I will introduce an extension for managing code snippets in VS Code

What is a code snippet? When we write code, the small square next to it is a code snippet

Snippets are great, how do we create our own?

First create a code snippet file

then edit the JSON

Use it and see the effect

Editing snippets also need to modify JSON

Use it and see the effect

Editing JSON is a bit inconvenient. Is there a tool that can select a piece of code to create a snippet, and can modify the snippet intuitively?

Yes, the extension "Snippets Manager" can do it

First searching for snippets manager

then click install

Select a piece of code to create a snippet

Use it and see the effect

Modify snippets via the snippet editor

Use it and see the effect

Search for snippets

Modified extension snippets need to reload VS Code to take effect

Use it and see the effect

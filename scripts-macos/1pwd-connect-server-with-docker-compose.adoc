= 1Password Connect Server Setup

== Configure 1Password Connect Server with Docker Compose

For hosting the 1Password Connect server, use Docker Compose to define and run
the two necessary services: connect-api and connect-sync. This approach is
robust and repeatable.

. Create a Secrets Automation Workflow on 1Password.com to get your server
credentials. Download the 1password-credentials.json file and save it in a
dedicated directory for your server, for example, ~/1password-connect/.

.~/1password-connect
[source, bash]
----
mkdir ~/1password-connect

----
. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the same directory (~/1password-connect/) with the following content. This configuration sets up a persistent volume for data and links the credentials file.

[source, yaml]
----
yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  connect-sync:
    image: 1password/connect-sync:latest
    environment:
      - OP_BUS_PEERS=127.0.0.1:11224
    volumes:
      - ./1password-credentials.json:/home/opuser/.op/1password-credentials.json
      - connect-data:/home/opuser/.op/data
    networks:
      - connect-net
    restart: always

  connect-api:
    image: 1password/connect-api:latest
    environment:
      - OP_BUS_PEERS=127.0.0.1:11224
    volumes:
      - ./1password-credentials.json:/home/opuser/.op/1password-credentials.json
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - connect-net
    depends_on:
      - connect-sync
    restart: always

volumes:
  connect-data:

networks:
  connect-net:
    driver: bridge
----

. Launch the server: From the ~/1password-connect/ directory, run:

[source, bash]
----
sh
docker compose up -d
----

This command starts the containers in the background. Your server will be
accessible at http://localhost:8080.
